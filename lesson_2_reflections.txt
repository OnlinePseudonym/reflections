Q. What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

initialize before you can commit your repository

Q. How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per
logical change?

commit.

Q. What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your
history organized? How would branches help?

A. When adding a new feature and you aren't sure how it will react with the
code it's a good idea to start a new branch for that feature. If you have a beta
version it'd be wise to branch and leave your release version untouched so you
can continue to provide support for it.
