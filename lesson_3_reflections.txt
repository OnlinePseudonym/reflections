Q. When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all
your work local?

A. Anytime you're working collaboratively or want to share your code with the
public.

Q. Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

A. I'm not certian, I suppose you could acheive the same thing by creating a new
branch and working on that exclusively while git constantly updated your remote
repository.
