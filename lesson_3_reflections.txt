Q. When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all
your work local?

A. Anytime you're working collaboratively or want to share your code with the
public.

Q. Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

A. I'm not certian, I suppose you could acheive the same thing by creating a new
branch and working on that exclusively while git constantly updated your remote
repository.

Q. Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you
use one instead of another?

A. A fork is a copy that is credited to the orginal but not directly linked, you
would use this when you want to work on your own version of a repository. A
clone is an exact copy of the original repository you can clone a copy from your
online repository to a local one and vice versa. And a branch is a path from the
orginal master of the original code that you could use to work one specific bug
fixes and feature adds and easily merge with the master.
